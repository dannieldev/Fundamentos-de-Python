Where the brook kindly whispers and the birches sway. Light locks in motion, lingering emotion 
A rose scented breeze from the Fae Dew drops glitter, the dale is quiet and fair
Dreams coming true for lovers sleeping there Heather blushing in the evening sun’s last ray
The cool quiet night comes after a perfect day
Light locks in motion, lingering emotion
A rose scented breeze from the Fae
